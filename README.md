# pacbayes-adaptation-UAI2022

This is the code repository for “PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation Bounds for Multiclass Learners” to appear in [UAI 2022](https://www.auai.org/uai2022/).

This research was conducted in conjunction with [The Change that Matters in Discourse Parsing: Estimating the Impact of Domain Shift on Parser Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11317) to appear in Findings of [ACL 2022](https://www.2022.aclweb.org). 

Some of the code is shared across repositories as detailed below.

## Code
Code for running DANN experiments and summarizing DANN results is available in this repository. Code for running and summarizing additional experiments is available in the shared code repository [here](https://github.com/anthonysicilia/multiclass-domain-divergence). Further, a python package designed to compute key terms in the bounds we propose is available [here](https://github.com/anthonysicilia/classifier-divergence).

Please consider citing one or both papers if you use this code.
